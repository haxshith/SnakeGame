# SnakeGame
This Snake game application is a classic and responsive implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a snake controlled by arrow keys, moving on a canvas to consume red "food" squares, growing longer with each consumed food. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake itself.
